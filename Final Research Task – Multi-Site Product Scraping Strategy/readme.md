# 🏆 Final Research Task – Multi-Site Product Scraping Strategy

This project is part of my internship assessment where I was challenged to design a **scalable, accurate, and resource-efficient strategy** for scraping product data (titles, specs, images, details, etc.) from **100 heterogeneous websites** within **one week** with **95% accuracy**.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Scraping from **100+ websites with completely different schemas** poses challenges:
- Varying HTML structures & dynamic JavaScript content.
- Rate-limiting & anti-bot detection.
- Data normalization across sources.
- Ensuring high accuracy & quality of extracted data.
- Completing within **tight deadlines** and **limited budget**.

---

## 🔍 Proposed Solution
The solution is based on a **hybrid approach** combining:
1. **Selenium + Playwright** – For handling dynamic pages & JavaScript-rendered content.  
2. **BeautifulSoup / lxml** – For parsing static HTML efficiently.  
3. **ETL Pipeline** – Extract → Transform → Load into CSV/JSON/SQL.  
4. **ML/NLP Techniques** – Schema mapping and entity extraction from unstructured data.  
5. **Data Validation & Accuracy Checks** – Deduplication, regex validation, cross-field consistency checks.

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 1. Problem Analysis
- Different site schemas, CAPTCHAs, rate limits.
- Need automation with flexibility to adapt to unknown structures.

### 2. Tools & Technology
- **Selenium/Playwright** for interaction.
- **BeautifulSoup** for parsing.
- **Pandas** for transformation.
- **SQLite/MySQL** for structured storage.
- **Optional ML models** for semantic extraction.

### 3. Resource Optimization
- Reusable scraping templates.
- Modular pipeline design.
- Parallel processing (where safe).

### 4. Accuracy Strategy
- Rule-based + ML-assisted validation.
- Random sample manual QA.
- Fallback error logging and retry system.

### 5. Timeline Management
- Day 1–2 → Build base scraper + templates.  
- Day 3–5 → Apply to multiple sites in parallel.  
- Day 6 → Quality assurance & validation.  
- Day 7 → Final report + delivery.  

### 6. Risk Mitigation
- **Anti-bot detection** → Rotating proxies, human-like delays.  
- **Schema variability** → ML-based field mapping.  
- **Time constraints** → Prioritize top-traffic sites, parallelize.
